##### What's in our dataset ?

The is a dataset that includes total sales figures for 45 Walmart Locations broken down by store departments.  When available, up to 5  markdowns figures (promotion/discounts) used at each store are provided.  Please note that identifiable information regarding the locations and the nature of the discounts have been removed.  We will limit our analysis to periods where a store provides markdown data.
