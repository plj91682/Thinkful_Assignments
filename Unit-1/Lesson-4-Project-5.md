### DRILL: Make a quick research proposal
#### Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

#### The problem

Compare 2 Public figures and their corresponding Public Relations campaigns to determine who best to represent and lead the Jedi
This problem has real-world applicability to modern political campaigns.

#### The potential solution

To find the most effective ambassador for the Jedi, both candidates should present their campaigns to very equally samples.

Efficiency should be consdiered.

A time and cost effecient way to do this is to create 2 very large sample sizes across all 8 planets, Group-A and Group-B.
This will eliminate inter-planetary bias since we are creating a samples across all 8 planets.

Group-A will watch and listen to JarJar's campaign
Group-B will watch and listen to Windu's campaign

After listening to their respective candidate, a poll or survey shall be given out and results recorded.



#### The method of testing the solution

This above experiment should be repeated once a week for 2 months to gather enough data.

Each survey will be scored and have a favorability-rating number.

To test the effectiveness of each campaign a T-Values and P-values can be calculated and compared between Windu and JarJar's favorability rating.
