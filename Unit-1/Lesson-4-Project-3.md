### DRILL: Am I Biased?

#### For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.

1. You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
```
There is sampling-bias because February is still winter so demand for bathing suits will be very low
May will have a high demand for bathing suits so will skew results against the February email compaign.
```

1. You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
```
There is bias in assignment to conditions because the population of people who visit the clinic will have a higher tendency for anxiety than the general population.
```

1. You launch a new ad-billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
```
1-week, is not long enough trial - time to determine if the increase is due to the ad-campaign.
The assumptions regarding the demographic breakdown of people in that location may not represent the people who shop at the website.
```

1. You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
```
1-week, is not long enough trial - time to determine if the experiment worked.

There is no mention about how the loyalty program is being advertised (in-store, online, etc ?)

There is no mention of the website demographics/age-groups/etc.
